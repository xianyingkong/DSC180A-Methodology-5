### [B05] Diffusion Process as a Generative Model
Mentor: Arya Mazumdar

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered this quarter is the mathematical details of the diffusion model. Even though we did not explicitly go through this during our section, but I took time to investigate into it, specifically the key features of the model, and what made the model work well. This became interesting as different parameters were being experimented, including different noise distributions, to see how changing some of the key features of the model impact the model's performance.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

In Quarter 1, I played around with the training section and the setup of the probabilistic model - all using UNet and working with images. A potential investigation in Quarter 2 would involve trying different neural networks, such as RNN, transformers etc, instead of UNet (that is most useful for image segmentation). Furthermore, with diffrent types of neural network, we could expand to other types of dataset. For example, RNN/transformers for text data + diffusion model.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

Personally, this quarter I've mostly been referring to a single source for code and learning purpose. It was around Week 6/7 when I started looking into other papers and other ways of implementing the same model/ neural network. I realized that I was able to learn quicker/ find answers to my questions much easier and quicker when I looked into different sources and comparing them. Furthermore, it is also a good idea to get my hands on the code as soon as possible to understand how things *actually* work together, rather than dwelling on the nitty-gritty mathematical details (at least not for more than a week).

In terms of teamwork, a potential change would be to improve task deligation according to every member's interests & strengths. In Quarter 1, as we are all learning about our domain, my teammates and I have been working together on the same tasks and we share during our private team meetings 2 times a week. This has been great but may not be the best approach for Quarter 2 Project given the scale of our project and limited time.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

One technique that I am very interested in, which I am sure we will get to eventually, is building an interactive UI once we have our final model. I look forward to building one that allows users to click on a button/ enter a prompt to instruct the model and receive an output.
